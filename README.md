## Reown Integration

This project integrates **Reown**, an on-chain UX platform, to facilitate secure and user-friendly interactions with blockchain assets and identities. The core of this integration is handled through the `@reown/appkit` and `@reown/appkit-adapter-wagmi` packages, which provide essential tools for managing on-chain identities and assets seamlessly.

### How it works:

- **Reown AppKit** (`@reown/appkit`) provides the main SDK for interacting with Reown's on-chain identity and assets management features.
- **Reown Wagmi Adapter** (`@reown/appkit-adapter-wagmi`) bridges Reown with the Wagmi library, enabling smooth integration with Ethereum wallets and providers.
- **Wagmi** and **Viem** are used for connecting to Ethereum networks, managing wallet connections, and performing blockchain operations.
- **React Query** (`@tanstack/react-query`) handles data fetching, caching, and synchronization for a responsive user experience.

### Usage with Project ID

Your project is identified with a unique **project ID** (please replace `<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>` with your actual ID). This ID links your application to your specific Reown project, enabling features like identity verification and asset management.

```js
export const config = getDefaultConfig({
  appName: 'Amulet AI',
  projectId: import.meta.env.VITE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID!,
  chains: [seiTestnet],
  transports: {
    [seiTestnet.id]: http(),
  },
});
```

This setup allows the app to leverage Reown’s decentralized identity and asset features, providing users with a secure and transparent experience.

## Blockchain & Token Details

- The app connects to the **Sei Testnet** blockchain using RainbowKit and wagmi libraries, configured in `src/wagmi.ts`.
- The `VITE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID` environment variable is required for wallet connection.
- The app interacts with a specific ERC20 token at address:  
  **`0xe8564273D6346Db0Ff54d3a6CCb1Dd12993A042c`** (Sei Testnet ERC20 token).

### Constants & Token Contract

- The app uses a minimal ERC20 ABI for token interactions, including functions like `name`, `symbol`, `decimals`, `balanceOf`, and `transfer`.
- These constants are stored in `src/shared/constants.ts` for easy reuse across the codebase.

# 🪪 Sign-In With Ethereum (SIWE) Authentication

This project implements **SIWE (Sign-In With Ethereum)** to authenticate users using their crypto wallet instead of traditional credentials.  
Authentication is handled through an **EIP-4361 signed message**, verified server-side, and stored in a **secure session cookie**.

## Why SIWE?

- 🔐 Passwordless authentication  
- 🦄 Integrates seamlessly with RainbowKit + Wagmi  
- 🍪 Uses secure, HTTP-only cookies for sessions  
- 🧱 Protects dApp routes  
- ⚡ Works across page reloads

---

# ✨ Architecture Overview

SIWE authentication consists of:

| Layer | Responsibility |
|-------|----------------|
| **Frontend (React)** | Builds + signs EIP-4361 message, manages auth state, RainbowKit integration |
| **Backend (Vercel Serverless)** | Generates nonce, verifies signatures, stores secure cookies |

The frontend signs messages; the backend verifies them.

---

# 🏗 Backend (Vercel Serverless Functions)

Backend code lives under:

```
/api/siwe/
  - nonce.ts
  - verify.ts
  - me.ts
  - logout.ts
```

All endpoints include proper CORS headers and use secure cookies (`HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=None`).

---

## 1. `GET /api/siwe/nonce`

Generates a secure SIWE nonce using the official SIWE helper:

```ts
import { generateNonce } from "siwe";

const nonce = generateNonce();
// Stores it in a cookie:
document.cookie = "siwe-nonce=<nonce>; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=None";

// Returns the nonce to the frontend.
```

## 2. POST /api/siwe/verify

Payload:
```json
{
  "message": "<prepared EIP-4361 message>",
  "signature": "<wallet signature>"
}
```

Verification steps:
- Read `siwe-nonce` cookie
- Construct `SiweMessage(message)`
- Verify signature + nonce

If valid → create session cookie:

```ts
// Example of setting session cookie:
document.cookie = "siwe-session={\"address\":\"0x...\",\"chainId\":...}; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=None";
```

## 3. GET /api/siwe/me

Restores existing session:

**Authenticated:**
```json
{ "address": "0x1234..." }
```

**Not authenticated:**
```json
{ "address": null }
```

Used by the frontend on page load.

## 4. POST /api/siwe/logout

Clears authentication:

```ts
// Clear session cookie:
document.cookie = "siwe-session=; Max-Age=0; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=None";
```

Session removed.

---

# 💻 Frontend (React + Wagmi + RainbowKit)

Frontend SIWE files:

```plaintext
src/auth/siwe.ts
src/providers/Web3Provider.tsx
src/providers/AuthStatusContext.ts
src/providers/useAmuletAuthStatus.ts
```

🔹 **src/auth/siwe.ts** — SIWE Adapter  
Implements RainbowKit’s `createAuthenticationAdapter()`:

- `getNonce()` → calls backend
- `createMessage()` → builds SIWE message
- `verify()` → POST `/verify`
- `signOut()` → POST `/logout`

All requests use:

```ts
credentials: "include"
```

🔹 **Web3Provider.tsx** — Global Web3 + SIWE Wrapper  
Wraps the app with:

- `WagmiProvider`
- `RainbowKitProvider`
- `RainbowKitAuthenticationProvider`
- `AuthStatusContext`

On load, it calls:

```ts
GET /api/siwe/me
```

to restore previous sessions.

Maintains SIWE state:

```plaintext
"loading" | "unauthenticated" | "authenticated"
```

🔹 **AuthStatusContext.ts**  
Simple global context:

```ts
export const AuthStatusContext = createContext<AuthStatus>("loading");
```

Stores SIWE authentication status across the app.

🔹 **useAmuletAuthStatus.ts**  
Small hook:

```ts
const status = useAmuletAuthStatus();
```

Used in components + guards to check whether the user is authenticated.

---

# 🔐 Route Protection (WalletGuard)

Routes are only accessible when:

- Wallet is connected
- SIWE session is authenticated

Otherwise users are redirected to `/auth`.

🛰️ Blockchain RPC Access (via Serverless Proxy)

To protect our private Sei RPC endpoint and avoid exposing it directly to the frontend, the DApp connects to the blockchain through a dedicated serverless RPC proxy deployed on Vercel:

https://sei-rpc-proxy.vercel.app/api/rpc

Why a Proxy?

Hides the real RPC URL

Prevents exposing API keys or private nodes

Adds a security layer between users and the blockchain

Avoids rate-limit or misuse of upstream RPC endpoints

Allows future middleware such as caching, method filtering, or request logging

How It Works

All blockchain calls go through a tiny backend service located in:

/api/rpc.ts  (in the sei-rpc-proxy project)


This serverless function:

Receives JSON-RPC requests from the frontend

Forwards them to the upstream Sei RPC defined in the server’s environment variable (SEI_RPC_URL)

Returns the response back to the DApp

The actual RPC used is not exposed to the browser.

Frontend Configuration (Wagmi)

In src/wagmi.ts, the DApp is configured to use the proxy instead of a direct blockchain URL:

export const config = getDefaultConfig({
  appName: 'Amulet AI',
  projectId: import.meta.env.VITE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID!,
  chains: [seiTestnet],
  transports: {
    [seiTestnet.id]: http('https://sei-rpc-proxy.vercel.app/api/rpc'),
  },
});

Backend Environment Variable

On the RPC proxy server (Vercel project), you must define:

SEI_RPC_URL=https://evm-rpc-testnet.sei-apis.com


This variable is never exposed to the client.
